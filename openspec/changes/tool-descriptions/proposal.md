# Change: Standardize Tool Descriptions for AI Agent Comprehension

## Why

AI agents sometimes have difficulty interpreting JSON schemas alone and need assistance to correctly call MCP tools. Without comprehensive descriptions including usage examples, agents waste time with trial-and-error approaches, leading to incorrect tool invocations and poor user experience.

## What Changes

Establish a standard format for all MCP tool descriptions that includes:
1. Full description of tool purpose and use cases (markdown)
2. JSON Schema generated by Pydantic (in code fence with type annotation)
3. General usage instructions (as code)
4. Concrete examples with explanations (as code with commentary)

Create a template/README in `src/mcp_guide/tools/` that documents this standard and serves as a reference for all new tools. Add comments in tool modules pointing to this template.

Verify that Pydantic schema generation includes complete field descriptions by ensuring all `Field()` definitions have `description` parameters.

- Add `src/mcp_guide/tools/README.md` with tool description template and standards
- Add comments in existing tool modules referencing the template
- Audit existing tools to ensure Pydantic models have complete field descriptions
- Update tool infrastructure spec to document the description standard

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: `tool-infrastructure`
- **Affected code**:
  - `src/mcp_guide/tools/README.md` - New template and standards document
  - `src/mcp_guide/tools/tool_*.py` - Add reference comments
  - Tool argument Pydantic models - Ensure Field descriptions are complete
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced trial-and-error by AI agents
  - Consistent tool documentation across the project
  - Easier onboarding for new tool development
  - Better AI agent comprehension leading to correct tool usage

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `src/mcp_guide/tools/README.md` created with complete template showing all 4 sections
- [ ] Template includes example of proper Pydantic Field descriptions
- [ ] All tool modules have comment pointing to README
- [ ] Audit confirms all existing tool argument models have Field descriptions
- [ ] Spec delta added to tool-infrastructure documenting the standard
