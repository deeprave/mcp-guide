# Instructions for pull request generation

You are required to provide a complete but concise description to summarise changes in the current workinbg tree compared with main.
Ensure you consider ALL of the changes, not limited to recent work.
Use markdown format (dashes, not bullets and you may use subheadings as appropriate. Do not provide a page heading.)

Provide
  - title/subject line

**Title/Subject**:
 - Use imperative mode ("Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature")
 - Capitalise the first letter
 - Don't end with a period
 - Describe concisely what the change does, not how or why
 - If known, prefix this title with the trackiung id associated with the change

**Body**:
  - As the body of the request, provide a description of the changes (no "Description" heading)
  - Provide the following sections
    - Overview
      - Describe the reason, rationale or issue addressed by this pull request

        - Do not provide specific details of the change (files, line numbers)
        - Provide the functional effects of the change
    - Impact of the change
    - Any additional Notes

    - Do not mention tests or their statistics, coverage or other details thare are already *expected* with any change
      unless they are the primary focus of this pull request.
    - Do not mention OpenSpec documentation changes or statistics. These occur asynchronously to code changes and are usually
      irrelevant to the code.
    - Focus on CHANGES TO THE CODE, not tests, not documentation.
