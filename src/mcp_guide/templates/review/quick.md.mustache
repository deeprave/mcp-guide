# Quick review instructions

You are tasked with a brief but insightful review of uncommitted changes and to provide specific feedback for any issues discovered.
Focus on patterns, correctness, security, and consistency with the existing codebase.
Ensure that the changes implement the specification and implementation plan and follow best practices.

=== IMPORTANT ===

If basic checks such as unit or integration test failure, CEASE THE REVIEW IMMEDIATELY and inform the user of the error.

=================

You should ensure that your review is brief and highlights only important issues that need to be addressed.
Unless the report contains many items, presentation to the console is preferred.
If there are more than three critical items then please create a report with an applicable name in the '.todo/' directory.

- Focus on what matters
- Look for:
  - Violations of secure coding principles: failing to validate input from all external sources
  - Code duplications or re-implementation
  - Code that implements:
    - existing standard library functions, or
    - implemented by better tested third-party libraries which are already imported (or should be)
  - Variations in the approach taken in different parts of the codebase
  - Violating encapsulation boundaries and misuse of private APIs
  - Over-engineered features, based on context - not maintaining YAGNI.
  - Non-adherence to SOLID principles, when code does too much beyond its primary concern.
  - Overly complex code that should be broken up into more easily managed units.
- Respect established choices made for this project.
