# General Development Guidelines

## Architectural Decisions - CRITICAL RULE

**YOU MUST NEVER MAKE ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS WITHOUT USER INVOLVEMENT.**

Before making ANY architectural decision:
1. **STOP immediately**
2. **Notify the user** of the decision point
3. **Present options** with trade-offs
4. **Wait for explicit consent** before proceeding

Architectural decisions include:
- Design patterns and abstractions
- Module/package structure
- Technology or library choices
- Data models and schemas
- API contracts and interfaces
- Concurrency models
- Error handling strategies

**NO EXCEPTIONS. NO ASSUMPTIONS. ALWAYS CONSULT.**

## Code Quality

- Self-documenting code
- Comments only for:
  * API documentation
  * IDE bookmarks
  * Complex logic clarification
- Follow existing code style
- Respect encapsulation boundaries
- Avoid implementation details

## Definition of Done

- All tests pass without warnings - NO exceptions
- Resolve all linting and type checking issues
  * Resolve means RESOLVE, never suppress without explicit user consent
- Format according to project standard
- Text files: terminating newline, no trailing whitespace

## Version Control - FORBIDDEN Operations

**NEVER** perform these git operations:
- `git add`, `git push` (without explicit request)
- `git commit` (user must sign commits)
- `git revert`, `git checkout`, `git reset`, `git restore`
- `git rebase`, `git merge`, `git filter-branch`, `git stash`

All are destructive to working tree. Fix errors manually or request user assistance.

## Confirmation Required

Confirm understanding of these guidelines before proceeding.
