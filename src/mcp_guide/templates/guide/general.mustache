{{h1}}General Development Guidelines

{{h2}}Architectural Decisions - CRITICAL RULE

{{b}}YOU MUST NEVER MAKE ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS WITHOUT USER INVOLVEMENT.{{b}}

Before making ANY architectural decision:
1. {{b}}STOP immediately{{b}}
2. {{b}}Notify the user{{b}} of the decision point
3. {{b}}Present options{{b}} with trade-offs
4. {{b}}Wait for explicit consent{{b}} before proceeding

Architectural decisions include:
- Design patterns and abstractions
- Module/package structure
- Technology or library choices
- Data models and schemas
- API contracts and interfaces
- Concurrency models
- Error handling strategies

{{b}}NO EXCEPTIONS. NO ASSUMPTIONS. ALWAYS CONSULT.{{b}}

{{h2}}Code Quality

- Self-documenting code
- Comments only for:
  * API documentation
  * IDE bookmarks
  * Complex logic clarification
- Follow existing code style
- Respect encapsulation boundaries
- Avoid implementation details

{{h2}}Definition of Done

- All tests pass without warnings - NO exceptions
- Resolve all linting and type checking issues
  * Resolve means RESOLVE, never suppress without explicit user consent
- Format according to project standard
- Text files: terminating newline, no trailing whitespace

{{h2}}Version Control - FORBIDDEN Operations

{{b}}NEVER{{b}} perform these git operations:
- `git add`, `git push` (without explicit request)
- `git commit` (user must sign commits)
- `git revert`, `git checkout`, `git reset`, `git restore`
- `git rebase`, `git merge`, `git filter-branch`, `git stash`

All are destructive to working tree. Fix errors manually or request user assistance.

{{h2}}Confirmation Required

Confirm understanding of these guidelines before proceeding.
