# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

## Core Concept

Focus on system behavior from user perspective using natural language. Extends TDD with business-readable specifications.

## Given-When-Then Format

```
Given [initial context/preconditions]
When [event or action occurs]
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional conditions]
```

**Example**:
```
Given a user has items in cart
When they proceed to checkout
Then they should see order summary
And total should include tax
```

## Key Principles

- **Behavior Over Implementation**: Describe what system does, not how
- **Concrete Examples**: Use real data, not abstractions
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared vocabulary between technical and business stakeholders
- **Outside-In**: Start with user-facing behavior, work toward implementation
- **Living Documentation**: Specifications stay synchronized with code

## BDD Process

1. **Discovery**: Explore requirements, identify rules and examples
2. **Formulation**: Write examples in Given-When-Then format
3. **Automation**: Turn examples into automated tests, implement behavior

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use domain language, not technical jargon
- Make scenarios concrete and specific
- Focus on business value
- One action per When clause
- Scenarios should survive refactoring
- Avoid testing internal implementation

## BDD vs TDD

- **Focus**: Business behavior vs code correctness
- **Language**: Domain/business vs technical
- **Scope**: Feature level vs unit level
- **Direction**: Outside-in vs inside-out
