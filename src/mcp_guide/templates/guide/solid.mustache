# SOLID Principles

## S - Single Responsibility Principle

**Rule**: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

- Each class has single, well-defined responsibility
- Multiple responsibilities = multiple reasons to change
- Changes to one responsibility shouldn't affect others

## O - Open/Closed Principle

**Rule**: Open for extension, closed for modification.

- Add new behaviour without changing existing code
- Extend through inheritance, composition, or interfaces
- Use strategy pattern, dependency injection, abstract classes

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle

**Rule**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

- Subclasses must strengthen, not weaken, contracts
- Don't throw unexpected exceptions in subclass
- Don't require stronger preconditions
- Don't provide weaker postconditions
- Preserve invariants

## I - Interface Segregation Principle

**Rule**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use.

- Many specific interfaces better than one general interface
- Split large interfaces into smaller, focused ones
- Clients depend only on methods they use
- Reduces coupling and side effects

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle

**Rule**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- Both depend on abstractions
- Abstractions don't depend on details
- Use dependency injection and program to interfaces

## Architectural Impact

- **Modularity**: Clear boundaries between components
- **Maintainability**: Localized, predictable changes
- **Testability**: Small, focused classes; mockable dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Easy extension without modification
- **Scalability**: Independent components scale separately

## Application Guidelines

- Apply when complexity emerges, don't over-engineer early
- Balance principles based on context
- Watch for code smells: large classes (SRP), shotgun surgery (OCP), refused bequest (LSP), fat interfaces (ISP), tight coupling (DIP)
