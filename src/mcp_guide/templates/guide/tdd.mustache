# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## The TDD Cycle: Red-Green-Refactor

1. **Red**: Write a failing test for the next functionality
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green

## Core Rules

- Never write production code without a failing test first
- Write only enough test code to demonstrate a failure
- Write only enough production code to pass the failing test
- Each cycle should take minutes, not hours

## Implementation Guidelines

- Work in small increments
- Run tests after every change
- Commit after each successful cycle
- Refactor immediately, don't accumulate technical debt
- Let tests drive the design

## Key Principles

- **Test First**: Tests written before implementation
- **Minimal Steps**: Smallest possible increments
- **Continuous Refactoring**: Clean code after each green test
- **Fast Feedback**: Run tests frequently

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Writing tests after code
- Making steps too large
- Skipping refactor phase
- Testing implementation details instead of behavior
- Not running tests frequently
