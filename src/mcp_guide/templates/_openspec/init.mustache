To initialize OpenSpec in this project, please run:

`openspec init`

This will create the required directory structure:
- openspec/project.md
- openspec/changes/
- openspec/specs/

After initialization, refresh the cache by running `openspec list --json` and sending via {{tool_prefix}}send_file_content with path `.openspec-changes.json`.
