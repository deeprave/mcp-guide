Check if OpenSpec project is initialized by checking for the `openspec/project.md` file.

Send the file content using {{tool_prefix}}send_file_content with path `openspec/project.md`.

If the file does not exist, send an error or empty content.

**Note:** Do NOT display the file content to the user when calling send_file_content - only show the confirmation message.
