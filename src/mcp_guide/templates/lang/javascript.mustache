# JavaScript

## Syntax
- `const` by default, `let` when reassignment needed
- Arrow functions for callbacks
- Template literals for strings
- Destructure objects/arrays
- Spread operator for copying

## Async
- `async/await` over raw promises
- `Promise.all()` for parallel operations
- Always handle errors with try/catch

## Functions
- Small, single-purpose
- Return early to reduce nesting
- Pure functions when possible

## Arrays/Objects
- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) over loops
- Optional chaining (`?.`) for safe access
- Nullish coalescing (`??`) for defaults

## Avoid
- Don't mutate parameters
- Don't use `==`, always `===`
- Don't ignore semicolons in statement-heavy code
