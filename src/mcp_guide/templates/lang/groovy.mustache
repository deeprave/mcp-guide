# Groovy

## Language
- Optional typing for clarity
- Closures for functional programming
- GStrings for interpolation
- Safe navigation: `?.`
- Elvis operator: `?:`

## Collections
- Literals: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[key: value]`
- Methods: `each`, `collect`, `find`, `findAll`
- Chain operations
- Spread operator: `*`

## Closures
- `it` for single parameter
- Name parameters for multiple
- Understand scope and delegation

## Metaprogramming
- Use judiciously
- `methodMissing`/`propertyMissing` carefully
- Document behavior
- Test thoroughly

## Gradle
- Groovy DSL for builds
- Use plugins
- buildSrc for shared logic

## Testing
- Spock for expressive tests
- Data-driven with `where:` blocks
- Keep readable

## Performance
- `@CompileStatic` for critical code
- Avoid excessive metaprogramming in hot paths
- Profile before optimizing

## Avoid
- Don't overuse dynamic features
- Don't ignore type safety when it matters
- Don't abuse metaprogramming
