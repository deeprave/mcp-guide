# React

## Components
- Function components only
- Small and focused
- Extract logic into custom hooks
- One component per file

## Hooks
- Follow Rules of Hooks (top level, same order)
- `useState` for local state
- `useEffect` for side effects - always specify dependencies
- `useMemo`/`useCallback` only when measured
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

## State
- Keep state local when possible
- Lift up only when needed by multiple components
- Use Context for global state
- Prefer derived state over storing computed values

## Props
- Destructure in signature
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use children prop for composition

## Performance
- Measure before optimising
- Use React DevTools Profiler
- `React.memo` for expensive pure components

## Patterns
- Controlled components for forms
- Error boundaries for errors
- Suspense for code splitting

## Avoid
- Don't mutate state
- Don't call hooks conditionally
- Don't forget effect dependencies
- Don't use index as key for dynamic lists
