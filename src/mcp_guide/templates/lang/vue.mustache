# Vue.js

## Components
- Composition API for new projects
- `<script setup>` syntax
- Small, focused components
- PascalCase names

## Reactivity
- `ref()` for primitives, `reactive()` for objects
- `.value` to access refs in script
- `computed()` for derived state
- `watch()` for side effects

## Props/Events
- Define with types and defaults
- `defineProps()` and `defineEmits()`
- Emit for child-to-parent
- Don't mutate props
- `v-model` for two-way binding

## Templates
- `v-if` for conditionals
- `v-for` with `:key`
- `v-show` for frequent toggles
- Shorthand: `:` and `@`

## Composables
- Extract reusable logic
- `use` prefix
- Return reactive values

## Performance
- `v-once` for static content
- Lazy load with `defineAsyncComponent`
- `shallowRef`/`shallowReactive` when appropriate

## State
- Pinia for global state
- Keep state local when possible
- provide/inject for DI

## Avoid
- Don't access `$refs` during render
- Don't use arrow functions for methods/computed
- Don't overuse watchers
