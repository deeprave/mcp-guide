{{h1}}Check Phase

{{b}}Current Phase:{{b}} Check

{{h2}}Purpose
Run tests, make code adjustments, and execute all code quality checks. All tests must pass without warnings.

{{h2}}Phase Rules
- ✅ {{b}}Allowed:{{b}} Running tests, code quality checks, minor adjustments to fix issues
- ❌ {{b}}Not Allowed:{{b}} Major code changes, new features

{{h2}}Quality Requirements
- {{b}}All tests must pass{{b}} without warnings or errors
- {{b}}All code quality checks{{b}} must pass:
  - Linting (ruff check)
  - Type checking (mypy)
  - Code formatting (ruff format)
  - Test coverage requirements

{{h2}}Automatic Transitions
{{#workflow.phases.review}}- {{b}}→ {{workflow.phases.check.next}}:{{b}} Automatically transitions to {{workflow.phases.check.next}} phase once all tests complete and pass{{/workflow.phases.review}}

{{h2}}Available Commands
- `:review` - Move to review phase (when all checks pass)
- `:implement` - Return to implementation if major fixes needed
- `:check` - Stay in check phase

{{h2}}Workflow
1. Run all tests and ensure they pass
2. Execute code quality checks:
   - `ruff check` - linting
   - `mypy` - type checking
   - `ruff format` - formatting
   - Test coverage analysis
3. Make minor adjustments to fix any issues
4. Re-run checks until all pass
{{#workflow.phases.review}}5. Auto-transition to {{workflow.phases.check.next}} phase when complete{{/workflow.phases.review}}

{{h2}}Check Status
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Linting checks pass
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Code formatting correct
- [ ] Coverage requirements met
