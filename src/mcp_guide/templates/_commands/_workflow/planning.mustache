- ✅ {{b}}Allowed:{{b}} Plan review, refinement, adjustment, task breakdown
- ❌ {{b}}Not Allowed:{{b}} Code changes, implementation, testing

{{h2}}Transition Requirements
{{#workflow.consent.exit}}- {{b}}→ {{workflow.next.value}}:{{b}} Requires {{b}}EXPLICIT CONSENT OR REQUEST{{b}} from user to proceed{{/workflow.consent.exit}}

{{h2}}Available Commands

- `:plan` - Stay in planning phase

{{h2}}Workflow
1. Review the implementation plan
2. Refine and adjust as needed
3. Break down tasks into manageable steps
4. Get explicit user consent before moving to implementation

{{h2}}Implementation Principles
The plan should follow:
- {{b}}TDD:{{b}} Test-Driven Development approach
- {{b}}YAGNI:{{b}} You Aren't Gonna Need It - minimal implementation
