# Style Policy: Async-First

In async applications, always prefer `async`/`await` over synchronous equivalents.

## Rules

- Any function that makes I/O calls, calls other async functions, or may be
  called from an async context should be `async`
- Exceptions:
  - Trivial pure functions with no I/O and no async callers
  - Functions that only call synchronous library functions and are unlikely to
    be extended with async behaviour
- Even in borderline cases, prefer `async` if the function is likely to evolve
- Never call blocking I/O inside an async function without wrapping in an executor

## Rationale

Consistent async code avoids subtle deadlocks and makes the concurrency model
explicit. Easier to maintain than a mixed sync/async codebase.
