# Style Policy: Interface Design (Go)

Define small, focused interfaces close to where they are consumed.

## Rules

- Interfaces should have one to three methods as a default
- Define interfaces in the package that consumes them, not the package that implements them
- Do not create interfaces speculatively — wait until there are two implementations
- Use interface embedding to compose larger interfaces from small ones

## Rationale

Go's implicit interface satisfaction works best with small interfaces. Large
interfaces are harder to implement and harder to mock in tests.
