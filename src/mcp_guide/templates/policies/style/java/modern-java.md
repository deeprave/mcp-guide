# Style Policy: Modern Java Features

Use current Java language features where they improve clarity.

## Rules

- Use `var` for local variables where the type is obvious from context
- Use records for immutable data carriers (Java 16+)
- Use sealed classes for closed type hierarchies (Java 17+)
- Use pattern matching in `instanceof` checks (Java 16+)
- Use text blocks for multi-line strings (Java 15+)
- Target the project's configured language level — do not use features above it

## Rationale

Modern Java features reduce boilerplate and improve readability.
