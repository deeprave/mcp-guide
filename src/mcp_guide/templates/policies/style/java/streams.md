# Style Policy: Stream API (Java)

Prefer the Stream API over imperative loops for collection processing.

## Rules

- Use `stream()`, `filter()`, `map()`, `collect()` etc. for collection transformations
- Use `forEach` only for terminal side-effects with no result
- Avoid imperative loops when a stream pipeline expresses the same intent clearly
- Do not force streams for simple single-step iterations where a loop is clearer

## Rationale

Stream pipelines are declarative and composable. They express what is being done
rather than how to iterate.
