# Style Policy: Modern C++

Use modern C++ features (C++17 minimum, C++20 preferred).

## Rules

- Use `auto` for type deduction where the type is clear from context
- Use range-based for loops
- Use structured bindings where applicable
- Use `std::optional`, `std::variant`, `std::string_view` from the standard library
- Use `if constexpr` for compile-time branching
- Target the project's configured standard — do not exceed it

## Rationale

Modern C++ reduces boilerplate, improves safety, and expresses intent more clearly
than pre-C++11 idioms.
