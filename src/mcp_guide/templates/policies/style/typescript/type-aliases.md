# Style Policy: Type Aliases Over Interfaces (TypeScript)

Prefer `type` aliases over `interface` declarations.

## Rules

- Use `type` for all type definitions
- Use `interface` only when declaration merging is explicitly needed
- Use `type` for union types, intersection types, and mapped types

## Rationale

`type` is more versatile and handles unions/intersections naturally.
Using one consistently reduces cognitive overhead.
