# Git Policy: Agent-Autonomous

The agent may perform all git operations, including staging, committing, branching,
and pushing, without per-operation consent.

## Rules

- All non-destructive git operations are permitted freely
- `git push` to feature branches is permitted
- `git push --force` to `main` or `master` is **always forbidden** — warn the user
- Destructive history rewrites (`filter-branch`, interactive rebase on shared branches)
  require explicit user instruction

## Rationale

Appropriate for solo developers or automated pipelines where speed matters more
than per-commit human review. Not recommended for shared branches or team
repositories without additional safeguards.
