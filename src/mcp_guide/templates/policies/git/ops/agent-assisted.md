# Git Policy: Agent-Assisted

The agent may stage files and create commits, but only with explicit per-request
user consent. Push operations require separate explicit instruction.

## Rules

- `git add` / staging: permitted when user explicitly requests it
- `git commit`: permitted when user explicitly requests it; the agent must
  present the staged diff and proposed commit message for user confirmation first
- `git push`: only with a separate, explicit "please push" instruction
- Destructive operations (`reset`, `rebase`, `force push`, etc.): forbidden
  unless the user explicitly names the operation

## Rationale

Suitable for teams where the agent is trusted to compose commits but the human
reviews and approves each one before it is created. Reduces friction while
keeping the user in control of history.
