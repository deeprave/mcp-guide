# Testing Policy: Strict (Default)

Strong structural rules apply to all tests written by the agent.

## Rules

- **No mocks** unless strictly necessary to avoid side-effects or create a
  specific scenario; never test mock behaviour
- **No conditionals** in tests — separate happy and error paths into distinct tests
- **No loops** in tests — use `parametrize` for repeated patterns
- **Never use "coverage"** in module, class, function, method, or variable names
- Test the public API, not implementation details
- Always name tests to describe what is being tested, not what coverage they achieve

## Rationale

These rules reduce false positives, improve test isolation, and make failures
easier to diagnose. Suited to teams that treat the test suite as a specification.
