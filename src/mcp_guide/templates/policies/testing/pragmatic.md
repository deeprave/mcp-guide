# Testing Policy: Pragmatic

Structural rules are guidance, not mandates. Mocks are permitted when useful.

## Rules

- Mocks are permitted when they simplify setup or avoid genuine side-effects;
  avoid testing mock behaviour
- Conditionals in tests should be avoided where practical but are not forbidden
- Loops in tests should be replaced with `parametrize` where practical
- Test the public API where possible; testing internals is acceptable when
  testing the public API is impractical
- Do not use "coverage" in test names

## Rationale

Suited to teams that value pragmatism over strict methodology. Rules are
applied with judgement based on context rather than enforced absolutely.
