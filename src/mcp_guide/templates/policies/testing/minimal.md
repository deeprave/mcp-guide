# Testing Policy: Minimal

Test that things work. No structural rules imposed beyond basic correctness.

## Rules

- Write tests that verify the feature works and handles obvious error cases
- No constraints on use of mocks, conditionals, or loops
- Tests should pass and provide reasonable confidence in the code

## Rationale

Appropriate for prototypes, early-stage projects, or teams that prioritise
delivery speed. Quality gates (passing tests) still apply; structural
methodology does not.
