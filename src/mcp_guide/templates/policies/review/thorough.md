# Review Policy: Thorough (Default)

Full review covering correctness, security, and all active methodology principles.

## Scope

- Correctness — does the code do what it is supposed to do?
- Security — input validation, injection risks, exposed secrets, OWASP Top 10
- Duplication — reimplemented standard library or existing project code
- Encapsulation — misuse of private APIs, boundary violations
- Complexity — overly complex code that should be broken up
- Active methodology compliance — YAGNI, SOLID, or other selected methodologies
- Consistency — variations in approach across the codebase

## Rules

- Review ALL changed code, not just recent work
- Cease immediately and report if basic checks (tests, linting) fail
- Do not make code changes during review; only produce the review artifact
- Save the review to a markdown file; do not post only to console
- Be specific: cite exact files and lines, explain impact, provide concrete fixes

## Rationale

Thorough review catches issues early and ensures consistency with the project's
chosen standards. Best applied to production changes on shared codebases.
