# Methodology Policy: SOLID Principles

Apply SOLID design principles to object-oriented code.

## Principles

- **S** — Single Responsibility: each class has one reason to change
- **O** — Open/Closed: open for extension, closed for modification
- **L** — Liskov Substitution: subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **I** — Interface Segregation: many specific interfaces over one general interface
- **D** — Dependency Inversion: depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Application guidelines

- Apply when complexity emerges; do not over-engineer early
- Balance principles based on context
- Watch for code smells: large classes (SRP), shotgun surgery (OCP),
  refused bequest (LSP), fat interfaces (ISP), tight coupling (DIP)

## Rationale

SOLID principles produce modular, testable, maintainable code. Best applied
once complexity warrants it rather than from the first line.
