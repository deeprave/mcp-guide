# Tooling Policy: No awk

Do not use `awk` for file or stream processing.

## Forbidden

- `awk` scripts for text transformation or data extraction in automated tasks
- `awk` for field splitting and reformatting in pipelines

## Permitted

- One-off diagnostic use in a shell session (not in scripts or agent actions)

## Use instead

- Language-native CSV/TSV parsing, string splitting, and structured data tools
- `jq` for JSON, `yq` for YAML, `csvkit` or similar for tabular data

## Rationale

`awk` programs embedded in shell strings are difficult to quote correctly, test,
and maintain. Structured parsers handle edge cases (quoting, encoding) that `awk`
one-liners silently mishandle.
