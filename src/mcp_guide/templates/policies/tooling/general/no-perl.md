# Tooling Policy: No perl one-liners

Do not use `perl` as a shell text-processing tool.

## Forbidden

- `perl -e`, `perl -p`, `perl -n`, `perl -i` for inline text transformation
- `perl` one-liners substituting for `sed` or `awk`

## Permitted

- Perl as a full programming language if the project is a Perl project
- Running existing Perl scripts that are part of the project's tooling

## Use instead

- Language-native string processing
- `sed` (if not also prohibited) or structured data tools

## Rationale

`perl -e` one-liners are typically write-only, quoting-sensitive, and opaque to
readers unfamiliar with Perl's special variables. Language-native code is more
readable and testable.
