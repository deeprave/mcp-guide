# Tooling Policy: No sed

Do not use `sed` for file content transformation.

## Forbidden

- `sed -i` for in-place file edits
- `sed` in pipelines for text mutation
- Any `sed` expression that modifies file content

## Permitted

- `sed -n` for read-only extraction (informational use)

## Use instead

- Language-native string operations and file I/O
- Structured tools appropriate to the file format (e.g. `jq` for JSON, `yq` for YAML)

## Rationale

`sed` expressions are brittle across platforms (GNU vs BSD), quoting-sensitive,
and hard to read and test. Language-native alternatives are more portable and maintainable.
