# Quality Policy: Standard

Warnings are addressed; coverage expectations are reasonable but not absolute.

## Rules

- Tests must pass; warnings should be resolved but are not hard failures
- Linting issues must be resolved
- Type checking issues should be resolved; minor suppressions with justification are acceptable
- Coverage is tracked but no hard minimum is enforced
- Format code to project standard

## Rationale

Balances quality with pragmatism. Suitable for most production projects
where some flexibility is needed without abandoning quality standards.
