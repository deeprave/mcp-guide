# Quality Policy: Zero Tolerance (Default)

All warnings are errors. Coverage thresholds are enforced. No exceptions.

## Rules

- All tests must pass with no warnings — treat `-Werror` as mandatory
- All linting issues must be resolved before a task is complete
- All type checking issues must be resolved; suppression requires explicit user consent
- Coverage must meet or exceed the project threshold (default: 90%)
- `pre-commit` hooks must pass before considering a commit ready

## Tools (Python)

- Test: `pytest -v -Werror -Walways`
- Lint: `ruff check`
- Types: `mypy` / `ty` / `pyright` (project choice)
- Format: `ruff format`

## Rationale

High standards prevent quality drift. Appropriate for production systems,
libraries, or any codebase where reliability is critical.
