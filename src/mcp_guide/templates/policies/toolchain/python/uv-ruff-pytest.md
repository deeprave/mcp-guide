# Toolchain Policy: uv + ruff + pytest (Python)

Modern Python stack: uv for packaging, ruff for linting and formatting, pytest for testing.

## Tools

| Role | Tool |
|---|---|
| Package manager | `uv` |
| Formatter | `ruff format` |
| Linter | `ruff check` |
| Type checker | `ty` or `mypy` (project choice) |
| Test runner | `pytest` |
| Build backend | `hatchling` |
| Pre-commit | `pre-commit` |

## Key commands

```bash
uv add --dev pytest pytest-cov ruff ty pre-commit
uv run pytest
uv run ruff format src tests
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Rationale

`uv` is significantly faster than pip/poetry. `ruff` replaces black, flake8,
isort, and more in a single fast tool. Together they form the current
state-of-the-art Python development stack.
