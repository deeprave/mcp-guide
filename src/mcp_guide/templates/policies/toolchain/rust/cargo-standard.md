# Toolchain Policy: Cargo standard (Rust)

| Role | Tool |
|---|---|
| Build + package manager | `cargo` |
| Test runner | built-in `cargo test` |
| Formatter | `rustfmt` |
| Linter | `clippy` |

## Key commands

```bash
cargo test
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

## Rationale

The standard Rust toolchain. `clippy` with `-D warnings` treats all lints as
errors, enforcing quality at CI time.
