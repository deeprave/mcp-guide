# Toolchain Policy: pnpm + eslint + vitest (JavaScript)

| Role | Tool |
|---|---|
| Package manager | `pnpm` |
| Formatter | `prettier` |
| Linter | `eslint` |
| Test runner | `vitest` |

## Key commands

```bash
pnpm add -D eslint prettier vitest
pnpm test
pnpm lint
```

## Rationale

`pnpm` is faster and more disk-efficient than npm. `vitest` has first-class ESM
support and a Jest-compatible API with faster cold starts.
