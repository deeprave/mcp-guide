# OpenSpec Workflow
{{#project.project_flags.openspec}}

OpenSpec is a spec-driven development workflow that aligns humans and AI on what to build before writing code.

## Directory Structure

```
openspec/
├── project.md          # Project conventions
├── specs/              # Source of truth
│   └── <component>/spec.md
└── changes/            # Proposed changes
    └── <feature>/
        ├── proposal.md # Why and what
        ├── tasks.md    # Implementation checklist
        └── specs/<component>/spec.md  # Deltas
```

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Draft Proposal
Create `openspec/changes/<feature>/` with:
- `proposal.md` - Must include `## Why` and `## What Changes` headers
- `tasks.md` - Implementation checklist
- `specs/<component>/spec.md` - Deltas (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED)

**Critical**: Specs must be `specs/<name>/spec.md` (directory + spec.md), not `specs/<name>.md`

### 2. Review & Align
```bash
openspec list                    # View active changes
openspec show <feature>          # Review details
openspec validate <feature>      # Check formatting
```

### 3. Implement
Work through `tasks.md`, marking items complete as you go.

### 4. Check
- Run all automated checks (tests, types, linting)
- Request user review explicitly
- Address feedback
- **Require explicit user approval** before archiving

### 5. Archive
```bash
openspec archive <feature> --yes
```
Merges changes to `openspec/specs/` and moves to `openspec/archive/`.

## Proposal Format

```markdown
# Feature Name

**Status**: Proposed
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low
**Complexity**: High/Medium/Low

## Why
- Problem being solved
- Importance and impact

## What Changes
- Components added/modified/removed
- Dependencies changed

## Technical Approach (Optional)
Implementation details

## Success Criteria (Optional)
Verification steps
```

## Delta Format

```markdown
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: New Feature
The system SHALL provide capability.

#### Scenario: Usage
- WHEN condition
- THEN behaviour

## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Updated Feature
(Complete updated text)

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Deprecated Feature
(What's being removed)
```

## Commands

```bash
# Viewing
openspec list [--changes|--specs]
openspec view                    # Interactive dashboard
openspec show <change> [--json]

# Validation
openspec validate <change> [--strict]  # REQUIRED before implementation

# Management
openspec archive <change> [--yes]
openspec update                  # Refresh instructions
```

## Best Practices

1. One change per feature - keep atomic
2. Complete specs before implementation
3. Use deltas - show only changes
4. Validate with `--strict` before implementing (REQUIRED)
5. Include Check phase in tasks.md
6. Never archive without explicit user approval
7. Archive promptly after approval

## OpenSpec vs .todo

- **OpenSpec**: Structured features with specs, formal workflow
- **.todo**: Quick fixes, investigations, reviews without specs
