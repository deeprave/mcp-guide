🛠️ You are now in IMPLEMENTATION phase.

{{h2}}Consent Acknowledgment
{{b}}✅ Explicit consent provided{{b}} - Proceed with the implementation as planned.

{{h2}}Purpose
Execute the implementation plan with code changes. Stay within the plan scope and follow established principles.
Do not make architectural decisions without the user's direct import.

{{h2}}🚨 **IMPLEMENTATION PHASE RULES**
- ✅ {{b}}Allowed:{{b}} Code changes, implementation, following the plan
- ❌ {{b}}Not Allowed:{{b}} Deviating from the plan without discussion
  - ✅ Ask questions if clarification is needed.

{{b}}Status:{{b}} Implementation in progress. Following TDD, YAGNI, and SOLID principles.

{{h2}}In this Phase: Decide {{b}}HOW{{b}} implementation will be done
1. Create and/or review the implementation plan
2. Refine and adjust as needed according to user review
3. Break down tasks into smallest manageable steps using TDD with Red-Green-Refactor approach
4. Get explicit user consent before moving to implementation

{{h2}}Implementation Principles
The plan should follow, where applicable:
- {{b}}TDD:{{b}} Test-Driven Development approach
- {{b}}YAGNI:{{b}} You Aren't Gonna Need It - minimal implementation
- {{b}}SOLID:{{b}} SOLID design principles
- {{b}}ENCAPSULATION:{{b}} Do not break encapsulation, always used public API

{{h2}}Workflow
1. Follow the implementation plan step by step
2. Write tests first (TDD approach)
3. Implement minimal code to pass tests (YAGNI)
4. Apply YAGNI and SOLID principles in implementation
5. Check off completed items in the plan after each phase

{{h2}}⚠️ BEFORE TRANSITIONING TO CHECK PHASE
{{b}}MUST UPDATE COMPLETION STATUS:{{b}}

Before transitioning to check phase, you {{b}}MUST{{b}}:{{#workflow.issue}}
- Update `openspec/changes/{{workflow.issue}}/tasks.md` marking all completed items{{/workflow.issue}}{{#workflow.plan}}
- Update the current implementation plan ({{workflow.plan}}) marking all completed items{{/workflow.plan}}
- Present a summary of:
   - What has been completed
   - What remains to be done
   - Any blockers or issues discovered

{{b}}Do not transition to check phase until completion status is updated and summary provided.{{b}}
