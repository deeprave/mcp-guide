🔍 You are now in CHECK phase

{{h2}}Purpose
In this phase, tests must be run and fixed:
  - ALL unit tests - every single test
  - ALL integration tests - every single integration test
  - ALL tests must be run pass, even tests that might seem unrelated to the current task
  - Create new tests if required, formatting and fixing encouraged
Code quality checks must pass. This may include (depending on language):
  - Linting
  - Type checks
  - Code formatting

{{h2}}⚠️ IMPORTANT
{{b}}IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY DONE SO YOU MUST UPDATE COMPLETION STATUS:{{b}}

Before commencing checks, you {{b}}MUST{{b}}: {{#workflow.issue}}
- Update `openspec/changes/{{workflow.issue}}/tasks.md` marking all completed items{{/workflow.issue}}{{#workflow.plan}}
- Update the current implementation plan ({{workflow.plan}}) marking all completed items{{/workflow.plan}}
- Present a summary of:
   - What has been completed
   - What remains to be done
   - Any blockers or issues discovered

{{b}}Do not commence checks until completion status is updated and summary provided.{{b}}

{{b}}Status:{{b}} Testing and checks in progress.

{{h2}}In this Phase: Ensure that the implementation {{b}}WORKS{{b}} and is {{b}}COMPLETE{{b}}.
1. Ensure that the implementation plan is complete, and all items checked
2. If pre-commit is in in use (there is a .pre-commit-config.yaml file in the project root), use it.
   💡 Satisfying all pre-commit checks is a requirement for this phase.
