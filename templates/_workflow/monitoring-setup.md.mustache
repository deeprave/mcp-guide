# Workflow Monitoring Active

Workflow tracking is enabled for this project.

## State File
- **Location**: `{{workflow.file}}`
- **Current Phase**: {{workflow.phase}}

## Your Role
- Monitor the workflow state file for changes
- Send file content when it's modified
- Follow phase-specific rules and permissions
- Use `get_content("docs/tracking")` for detailed workflow guidance

## File Change Detection
When `{{workflow.file}}` is modified:
1. Read the updated content
2. Send it using appropriate filesystem tools
3. Follow any phase transition instructions
