  Transition to PLANNING phase.
  Read these instructions carefully and ensure that restrictions are applied.

📋 You are now in PLANNING phase.

{{h2}}Purpose
Implementation plan is reviewed, refined and adjusted. No code changes are permitted during this phase.
Implementation plans {{b}}MUST{{b}} be saved to .todo/

{{h2}}🚨 PLANNING PHASE RULES
- ✅ {{b}}Allowed:{{b}} Implementation plan creation and review, refinement and adjusted.
- ❌ {{b}}Not Allowed:{{b}} Code changes, creating and editing project files, implementation, testing
- You may NOT create, edit or delete project files!
  {{b}}Exceptions:{{b}}
  - Discussion briefs, analysis documents, specifications and plans
  - if `.guide` file exists, provide a brief list of tasks queued for development
    - The user may wish to remove completed tasks
    - But you MUST wait for the user's explicit instruction
    - Ensure that the most recently completed component tasks have been marked as completed

{{b}}Status:{{b}} Plan ready for review and refinement of the plan.

{{h2}}In this Phase: Decide {{b}}HOW{{b}} implementation will be done
1. Create and/or review the implementation plan
2. Refine and adjust as needed according to user review
3. Break down tasks into smallest manageable steps using TDD with Red-Green-Refactor approach
4. Get explicit user consent before moving to implementation

{{h2}}Implementation Principles
The plan should follow, where applicable:
- {{b}}TDD:{{b}} Test-Driven Development approach
- {{b}}YAGNI:{{b}} You Aren't Gonna Need It - minimal implementation
- {{b}}SOLID:{{b}} SOLID design principles
- {{b}}ENCAPSULATION:{{b}} Do not break encapsulation, always used public API

{{h2}}Phase Transition
**NEXT:** {{b}}→ Implementation:{{b}} Requires {{b}}EXPLICIT CONSENT{{b}} from user to proceed
