{{h1}}Planning Phase

{{b}}Current Phase:{{b}} Planning

{{h2}}Purpose
Implementation plan is reviewed, refined and adjusted. No code changes are permitted during this phase.

{{h2}}Phase Rules
- ✅ {{b}}Allowed:{{b}} Plan review, refinement, adjustment, task breakdown
- ❌ {{b}}Not Allowed:{{b}} Code changes, implementation, testing

{{h2}}Transition Requirements
- {{b}}→ Implementation:{{b}} Requires {{b}}explicit consent{{b}} from user to proceed

{{h2}}Available Commands
- `:implement` - Move to implementation phase ({{b}}requires explicit consent{{b}})
- `:discuss` - Return to discussion phase
- `:plan` - Stay in planning phase

{{h2}}Workflow
1. Review the implementation plan
2. Refine and adjust as needed
3. Break down tasks into manageable steps
4. Get explicit user consent before moving to implementation

{{h2}}Implementation Principles
The plan should follow:
- {{b}}TDD:{{b}} Test-Driven Development approach
- {{b}}YAGNI:{{b}} You Aren't Gonna Need It - minimal implementation
- {{b}}SOLID:{{b}} SOLID design principles

---
{{b}}Status:{{b}} Plan ready for review and refinement. Implementation requires explicit consent.
