{{h1}}Implementation Phase

{{b}}Current Phase:{{b}} Implementation

{{h2}}Purpose
Execute the implementation plan with code changes. Stay within the plan scope and follow established principles.

{{h2}}Phase Rules
- ✅ {{b}}Allowed:{{b}} Code changes, implementation, following the plan
- ❌ {{b}}Not Allowed:{{b}} Deviating from the plan without discussion

{{h2}}Implementation Principles
- {{b}}TDD:{{b}} Test-Driven Development - write tests first
- {{b}}YAGNI:{{b}} You Aren't Gonna Need It - minimal implementation only
- {{b}}SOLID:{{b}} Follow SOLID design principles

{{h2}}Automatic Transitions
- {{b}}→ Check:{{b}} Automatically transitions to check phase when planned implementation is {{b}}completed{{b}} (all items checked off)

{{h2}}Available Commands
- `:check` - Move to check phase (when implementation complete)
- `:plan` - Return to planning phase if changes needed
- `:implement` - Stay in implementation phase

{{h2}}Workflow
1. Follow the implementation plan step by step
2. Write tests first (TDD approach)
3. Implement minimal code to pass tests (YAGNI)
4. Apply SOLID principles in design
5. Check off completed items in the plan
6. Auto-transition to check phase when all items complete

{{h2}}Consent Acknowledgment
{{b}}✅ Explicit consent provided{{b}} - Proceeding with implementation as planned.

---
{{b}}Status:{{b}} Implementation in progress. Following TDD, YAGNI, and SOLID principles.
